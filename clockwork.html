Key
		</b> You have a key somewhere on your body that you cannot reach. When the key is cranked and turning, you count as a creature. When it stops, you become an object. Your key stops turning when you become incapacitated. It also stops turning at the end of any round in which you got a total of 0 or lower on an attack roll or challenge roll. While you are an object, you cannot use actions, move, talk, or perceive your surroundings. Any creature that can reach you can use an action to wind up your key. If you are not incapacitated, you become a creature once more. If you are incapacitated, roll a d6. On a 3 or lower, there is no effect. On a 4 or higher, you heal 1 damage and become a creature at the end of the round. Although you are an object while you are incapacitated, you are still subject to the rules for incapacitated creatures.<br><br>
		<b>Mechanical Body</b> You do not eat, drink, or breathe. You do not age and you cannot be transformed into an undead creature. Your mechanical body makes it impossible for you to swim, so you sink to the bottom when you are submerged in liquid. <br><br>
		<b>Repairing Damage</b>While a creature, you heal damage as any other creature. If you are an object, a creature can use an action to start repairing you with a tool kit. The creature must work for at least 4 hours. At the end of this time, it makes an Intellect challenge roll with 1 bane. On a success, you heal damage equal to your healing rate.

		<b>Grind the Gears</b> You can increase the number of actions you can use on your turn by one. When you finish your turn, roll a d6. If you roll an odd number, you become an object at the end of the round.
